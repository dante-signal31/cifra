"""Module to attack Caesar cipher texts.

This module uses a brute force method to guess probable key used to cipher
a text using Caesar algorithm.

You should be aware that to be successful charset used for attack should be the
same used to cipher. Besides, this module tries to guess if deciphered text is
the good one comparing it with words from a language dictionary. If original
message was in a language you don't have a dictionary for, then correct key
won't be detected.
