NAME
====

**cifra** â€” Library and console command to crypt and decrypt texts using classic methods.

DESCRIPTION
===========
**cifra** is a console command and a python library to cipher and decipher texts
using classic methods. It also performs cryptoattacks against those methods.

I'm implementing this while I read Al Sweigart's *"Cracking Codes with Python"*.
